# traffic.js

Prototyping a Javascript library following the same declarative grammar as the Python [traffic](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic) library.

**This is very preliminary work.** Help appreciated.

## Memo

```sh
npm run build  # build package and serve on http://localhost:4000
npm publish # push new version to npm registry
npm test  # should run test but doesn't work yet for some reason
```
